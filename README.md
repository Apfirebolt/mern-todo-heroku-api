- Contains token based user auth system. 
- Each user can perform CRUD on ToDos.

## Built With

* [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)

## Project setup

Contains only back-end API at the time of writing but, eventually React frontend app would be added. Back-end is configured with package.json file at the root level. Install the dependencies, make sure you have mongoDB client installed on your system for local development or you can also use MongoDB Atlas for production deployment which does not require database to be setup on your system.

Nodemon would be serving the back-end API on local system.

```
npm install
npm run server
```
